Lakeside's math team began in the 2000-2001 school year with a small group of about 20 third graders. Since then, the math team has grown to include nearly 200 3rd, 4th, and 5th grade students every year. Each school year, math teamers practice for and then compete in three official contests through the Online Math League. <br><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sFwQ5r-udfw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>After each contest, teams have a fun "checking party" where the scores from that contest are unveiled. To add to the team spirit, math teamers have official team t-shirts, end-of-year awards, and a lunch party each spring. 

Over the years, Lakeside's math teams have been incredibly successful, winning national championships a total of *** times. The third grade team has won national championships in ***. The fourth grade team won national championships in ***. The fifth grade team won its first national championship in the 2016-2017 school year
